# TV Series

Note to people I see regularly, feel free to ask, I do have some of those series
on DVD/Blu-Ray.

## To watch

+ The Wire
  * Thanks to HBO Now

## Watched in 2016

+ Boardwalk Empire
  * Binge them all
+ Game of Thrones
  * Not all seasons are equals, but this season 6 was damned good!
+ The Strangers
  * excellent feels like reviving a better E.T.
+ The Leftovers
  * First season very well structured
  * Season two a bit more de-articulated
+ Silicon Valley
  * Not a big fan of the first half of the season 1
  * Season 2 is a great piece of fun!
